# Kind 2 Extension for VS Code
This extension provides basic support for the Lustre programming language with [Kind 2 Model Checker](https://kind2-mc.github.io/kind2) annotations.

This repository contains two projects:
- `extension` - the Kind 2 extension for VS Code extension.
- `interpreter` - an interactive webpage used by the extension for simulations
and counter-examples.
